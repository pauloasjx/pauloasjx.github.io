I work as a developer in several different fields. I've worked with many technologies in several different languages too, whether backend, frontend, mobile, data science and machine learning. Each of these areas used what seemed best suited to the problem. Currently, I've been working more with flutter, rust, typescript and python. After many years in the field, I believe that an important skill is learning on demand and being able to adapt.
